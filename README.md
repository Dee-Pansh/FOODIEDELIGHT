# Overview
> The FOODIEDELIGHT Restaurant Management Module allows restaurant administrators to manage restaurants on the platform. This includes adding, modifying, deleting, and listing restaurants. The data is fetched asynchronously from a backend application via API calls, ensuring a seamless and responsive user experience.


## Features

- **Add Restaurant**: Allows administrators to add a new restaurant with fields such as name, description, location, and additional relevant information.
- **Modify Restaurant**: Enables administrators to update the details of an existing restaurant.
- **Delete Restaurant**: Provides the functionality to remove a restaurant from the platform.
- **List Restaurants**: Displays a list of all restaurants on the platform with the ability to search and filter.
- **Data Validations**: Ensures that all necessary fields are filled with valid data.
- **Exception Handling**: Handles errors gracefully, providing feedback to the user without disrupting the experience.
- **Responsiveness**: The application is designed to be responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
